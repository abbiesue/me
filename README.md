A website about me

## Getting started

To check out the code and serve it:

    $ git clone https://github.com/abbiesue/me.git; cd me; . serve.sh

Then go to [localhost:8000/about.html](http://localhost:8000/about.html)

When you've had enough, just go to the terminal serving the site (where you ran the command above) and type âŒ˜-. (that's the command key plus the period). That will shut down the server. To remove all traces just pop up a directory and force-delete "me":

    $ cd ../ ; rm -rf me
